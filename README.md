# CHT-preCICE
This project implements a partitioned approach for conjugate heat transfer (CHT) simulation, by adapting and coupling three different open-source numerical solvers (OpenFOAM for fluids, CalculiX and Code_Aster for solids), using the multi-physics coupling library preCICE.

This code was developed as part of my Master's Thesis in Computational Science and Engineering at the Technische Universität München (TUM):

### Acknowledgements
This thesis was carried out at SimScale GmbH, a company that develops and provides a cloud-based engineering simulation platform (http://www.simscale.com).  I want to thank them for providing me with all the support, guidance and resources I have needed to complete this work.  I would especially like to thank Babak Gholami, my supervisor at SimScale, and Benjamin Uekermann, my supervisor at the TUM.
